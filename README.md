Experience a competitive 3D Snake game where multiple AI-controlled snakes navigate and grow within a defined cubic arena set against a galactic backdrop. Watch snakes hunt for food, avoid crashing into themselves or opponents, and react to special items like poison which trigger slow-motion camera effects. The simulation features dynamic camera modes, adjustable settings like world size and background density, and a real-time event log tracking the competition.
